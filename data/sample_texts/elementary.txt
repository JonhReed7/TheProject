The cat sat on the mat. The dog ran in the park. Birds fly in the sky. Fish swim in the sea. The sun is bright today. I like to play outside. My friend has a red ball. We play games together. The tree is very tall. Flowers grow in the garden. I have a pet rabbit. It likes to eat carrots. School is fun for me. I learn new things each day. Reading books is great. Stories take me far away.
